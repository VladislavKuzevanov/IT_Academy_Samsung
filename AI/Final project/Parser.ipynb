The fight scenes were epic( especially the one in the middle of the ocean). The final fight scene was amazing where they fought together against MechaGodzilla were Godzilla powered kong's axe which could deal devastating blows to the living weapon. I highly recommend this movie be watched in theatres( If you can). Your gonna have so much fun and intensity while watching this movie. Not to mention more monsters will be appearing including the return of a Skullcrawler and one of Ghidorah's Skull's. Ending was awesome when both of them showed mutual respect for each and Godzilla roared(which was just marvelous)\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pHZLrtRDd-Tt"},"source":["url = 'https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godzilla_vs_kong/reviews?type=user'\n","result = requests.get(url)\n","data = json.loads(re.search('movieReview\\s=\\s(.*);', result.text).group(1))\n","movieId = data[\"movieId\"]\n","result = get_reviews_on_page(result[\"pageInfo\"][\"endCursor\"] if 0 != 0  else \"\", movieId)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cnl_KPWEd-Tt","outputId":"e89ee7f2-965f-476e-d8df-48e5e212d6d6"},"source":["result[\"reviews\"][0]['review']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Giant hairy man vs larger pet lizard after he ate the man's last pizza slice.\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"EuEjYa2wd-Tu"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
