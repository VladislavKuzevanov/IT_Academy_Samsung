[SEP]\",\n"," \"[CLS] For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] The best thing you can say about Chris Columbus's adaptation is that he's incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] This cast is simply too generic. None of the young thespians stick out.

[SEP]\",\n"," \"[CLS] Imperfect, yes, but also both suitably imaginative and entertaining. Works as action-adventure razzle-dazzle, coming-of-age tale, and beginners' lesson on Greek mythology. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered, the obvious similarity of Percy Jackson to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand.

[SEP]\",\n"," \"[CLS] You don't even have to be familiar with the first book in Rick Riordan's popular fantasy series to enjoy Chris Columbus' energetic adaptation. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] This is generic filmmaking at its most banal, a simple-minded simplification of a not overwhelmingly complex book. [SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] Kids may well enjoy the adventures of The Lightning Thief on screen, but I think most readers will prefer the movie in their imaginations. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] An attempt to steal some of Harry Potter's thunder that also stands on its own as a well-made large-scale adventure that works well enough to entertain the teens it's hoping to strike. [SEP]\",\n"," \"[CLS] With great effects (and a few surprises) it's a fun, Saturday-matinee adventure. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] Columbus directs with his usual frying pan to the head. Music is forever swelling majestically. Characters are always opening wide their eyes and mouths to gaze in wonder. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] While this might not rival the later, better Harry Potter movies or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's more fun than you might expect. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] Percy Jackson & the Olympians sounds like an Otis Redding cover band. It is, instead, an unofficial cover of the Harry Potter franchise. [SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] The movie feels like a cut-rate Potter knockoff with a dash of Ray Harryhausen. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] In Columbus' hands, it once again all breaks down into a series of rushed, breathless special-effects setpieces, in a thrill ride that isn't headed anywhere new. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] The Lightning Thief makes the idea of a sequel seem like an inviting proposition. [SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] Columbus aims at nothing more than providing a rambunctious romp. He nimbly avoids the fate that has snared other film adaptations, like Eragon and Inkheart. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] gets so many things right that when it goes astray that you kind of wish it hadn't tried in the first place [SEP]\",\n"," \"[CLS] The Lightning Thief isn't electric, but it generates some spark when it varies the Grecian formula. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] Chris Columbus and his crew take a literal approach to spectacle that denies the magnificent use of weirdness and scale that famed stop-action animator Ray Harryhausen brought to such myth-inspired classics as \"Jason and the Argonauts\" (1963)... [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] Even with all its computer-generated fireballs, it's lukewarm medium-budget blockbustering. [SEP]\",\n"," \"[CLS] The disappearance of lightning simply is not interesting, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians sounds more like a '70s funk band than a kid's series. [SEP]\",\n"," \"[CLS] Uma Thurman demonstrates she can wear a snake-covered head as gracefully as Pierce Brosnan can trot around with a horse's netherlands. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] The Greek-gods premise lets the filmmakers indulge in some visually whizzy sequences that keep this rather lightweight action movie entertaining. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] Of all the players, Uma Thurman channels the Bride to deliver a Medusa the children won't easily forget when it comes to bedtime. [SEP]\",\n"," \"[CLS] Enjoyable, nicely paced family adventure with likeable characters, a strong central premise and some decent set-pieces, though the plot's a little hazy in places and the humour doesn't always work. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] Action movies of this scale often start off strong and wind down to forgettable finales, but Percy Jackson is the opposite, overcoming a clunky setup to deliver nearly all its thrills in the last half-hour. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] The Lightning Thief is all crass ineptitude and lost potential. Columbus' infantilizing of any character depth and use of leftover Harry Potter special effects will amuse only the smallest in your pantheon. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] The plot is a pretty blatant rehash of the typical \"coming-of-age hero\" tropes. Still, while \"Percy Jackson\" may not end up being the next huge and successful franchise, at the very least, it was an honest and amusing two hours. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] Young viewers probably will be entertained but even they are likely to realize that this could have and should have been better, especially by the time they're old enough to drive.

[SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] The camera work is frequently pedestrian, the acting is bland, and the jokes often fall flat. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] Director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the film's dippier moments. It's his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] Dutifully Potteresque it begins, and dutifully Potteresque it ends. [SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] Has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic, but none of the magic. [SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] Columbus knows his way around this kind of material even if some of the special effects look like they came from Deep Discount. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] Percy Jackson, you are no Harry Potter. You are not fit to walk in a hobbit's wake. [SEP]\",\n"," '[CLS] Too scary for younger fans of the popular book. [SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] The pleasant surprise is how deftly the story translates the myths from their classical idiom into modern ones and without losing the classical flavor [SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] ...great fun for the whole family. And if it introduces you and any young readers in your home to the books, so much the better. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] Sorry Mr. Jackson, but Harry Potter you ain't.

[SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] It's apparent that Potter may at last have a worthy successor.

[SEP]',\n"," '[CLS] ...an agreeable fantasy adventure that should leave fans of the genre satisfied. [SEP]',\n"," \"[CLS] Director Columbus never quite gets comfortable juggling the film's myriad characters, grandiose-but-stale CGI effects, and PG-friendly battle scenes, speeding headlong through endless plot points rather than taking the time to make any of them matter.
