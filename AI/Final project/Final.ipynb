is properly introduced with a touching backstory especially Cyborg,those who are not big fans of him will turn into Cyborg Superfans after watching this movie,apart from Cyborg a good introduction of Flash and his true capabilities,his contribution in the league and why he is one of the most important element of the group is clearly defined in this movie,action scenes are spine chilling and visually stuning like any other snyder movie and after every 5-10 mins there is some or the other action sequence which keeps the audience engaged and excited ,not even a single minute feels boring and the badass Steppenwolf is really really Frightening in this one a badass villain indeed completely opposite from what we saw in the 2017 Disaster called Josstice league.So yeah its a must watch,4 hrs will go by in a flash and at the end you will be left wanting for more!!',\n"," \"I think it is the worthy successor of MoS and BvS. Many parts were too long, it's true, like adding a lot of slow motion, which could have been avoided, but Zack Snyder wanted to show us all the work he and everyone involved have done. He wanted to show us his vision, a vision of the DC universe very good in my opinion. Many actors have been deprived of seeing their parts in this film, in fact they have achieved justice here and I am very happy to have been able to see this masterpiece.\",\n"," \"Like most people who are disappointed with the 2017 release, I was initially apprehensive about this new 4hrs Snyder cut which consists mostly of previously unused/unseen footage. Curiosity got the better of me in the end and the convenience of streaming means I can break it up into two or more sittings, something Snyder might have in mind as the same story is now retold in 6 parts (and a surreal epilogue) with title cards and I must admit it's a more complete experience that makes more sense. Reinstating Flash and Cyborg's backstories flesh out their characters properly and the re-rendered Steppenwolf gets additional screen time so he's less of a meaningless villainous cipher. The truth is there's just too much expositions for one film when it ought to have been two: one setting up the new characters and one returning Superman to the newly assembled League. It's overambitious, if not foolhardy, trying to squeeze everything into a 2hr film, which is what Whedon was tasked to do and therefore doomed to fail. While Snyder's special effects are an improvement, it remains jerky and unnatural looking, and the fight scenes mainly consist of repeatedly throwing each other against the wall with little consequences or any sense of peril whatsoever. Moreover, we now have to put up with his overbearing sense of grandeur and obsession with slow-mo's and atmospheric precipitation. So, basically it's a one step forward (no more CGI-tampering on Henry Cavill's face), and one smaller step back situation (two songs? really??) we find here. Ultimately, in this Snyder vs Whedon: (Smack)Down of Justice, the Snyder Redux corrects what Whedon fails to do justice to last time with a more singular vision and a wider canvas but it also highlights how indulgent and mismanaged the DC Cinematic Universe is/was back then.\",\n"," \"So much better than the original! Aqua man wasn't as lame, more of Flash and Victor,and hone with the stupid humor.\",\n"," \"Absolute incredibly film! Zack Snyder is going to save the DC cinematic universe, that's for sure! It is a behemoth of a film!\",\n"," 'The Justice League we deserved but not the one we needed (to save the DCEU at least).',\n"," \"The Snyder Cut was we needed when it first released but I'm glad they stayed on course. Loved it!!!\",\n"," 'We traded a terrible movie for a 4 hour version of the same terrible movie. ',\n"," '4 of the best hours of my life.',\n"," \"Much better than the original cut, but that only adds so much. It didn't all of a sudden turn into a masterpiece because they decided to release a version that was chopped to trash, just more digestible. It is broken down into acts and i suggest you take breaks as it is long as h*ll.\",\n"," \"This is a big improvement over the original release. It is a little long but the plot works better than what was released originally. I don't care for the 4 by 3 look.\",\n"," 'The movie what it should have been in the original cut. It tells the story in a more crisp way. The personality of the characters have got their due. It is always good to watch connected stories which relates to past events and gives you glimpses of the future plot, it makes it kind of real and fun.',\n"," \"A master piece, the Best Superhero Movies I've ever Seen thx Zack Snyder\",\n"," 'Amazing, 10 times better than the theatrical release.',\n"," \"Wow it was the same film but... worse? They improved a few things sure... but then made a lot more aspects worse.\\n\\nI'd say it's a little more enjoyable overall, but it certainly wasn't a better, or even good film.\",\n"," \"Every DC fan will be proud of this remake of old 2017's J.L \\nI will totally recommend it if you have watched 2017's version\\njack has killed it \\nit could be better if zack has directed totally from his vision\\nWE TOTALLY NEED ZACK's VERSION OF J.L Part 2 & 3\",\n"," \"Every character becomes more fleshed out, and it turns out that they did have arcs after all! Cyborg as the emotional core of the film is pivotal, culminating in a far more satisfying (and character-informed) finale when he rips apart the Mother Box's unity. The time reverse sequence with The Flash also harkens back to an emotional connection Barry has with his father, and it's also visually arresting. Batman being doggedly committed to resurrecting Superman because he now understands the importance of him and what he represents is much more meaningful in this film because it is more clear that Bruce, once cynical and grim, now operates from a place of faith. He believes in what Superman stands for. The addition of Superman's two fathers speaking wisdom and conviction into their son was also magnificent. And Darkseid's inclusion is bittersweet because this may be the last time we actually get to see him in this version of the DCEU. Painful to see what could have been (Batfleck, Henry Cavill, Cyborg), but glorious to see Snyder's vision for this film--if not for the extended universe--come to life.\",\n"," 'This was surprisingly very good. I really liked it broken down into parts. This is a fresh take and would love to see where this goes.',\n"," \"absolutely fantastic! if you don't like it, you don't get DC. \",\n"," 'A Justice League movie truly worthy of the title. A visually stunning, multilayered masterclass in cinema. A film that stands as proof that you can divert from the cookie cutter Superhero formula and deliver something unique and great.👍🏼👌🏽🔥🔥',\n"," \"What is to like about this movie? Not much. Is it better than the theatrical. Nope, they are both offal. All the characters are boring and flat. The action is mostly pointless and stupid, and the film is twice as long as it needs to be. Now to be fair it's not like any of the DC movies have been exceptionally good and it's not like the Marvel movies are good either, but at least they are generally fun. Snyder tries to make these epic statement movies, but the movies barely end up watchable the first time and are down right painful the second. Of course this is just my opinion. It seems like many people like the movie. If you like Snyder movies then you will like this. If you generally don't like his movies, then this is going to be nothing new.\",\n"," \"Absolutely enjoyed it, now the film's full story can be told as it should've been in 2017. A four hour span provides that deserved depth that was missing in the initial release. Great to see the DCEU back on track on the form of this film and the recent releases of others in the past two years.\",\n"," 'This version was SOOO much better than the first one.

Filled with beautiful imagery from the visuals of Zack Snyder, captivating scenes that tug your heart with a string, and relatable new heroes that all ages of audience find themselves rooting for. This movie is an entirely different presentation of what was shown in the 2017 version directed by Joss Whedon. Versions of the characters presented in the film shown 4 years ago such as Cyborg, the Flash, Batman, and Wonder Woman are given a complete 180 with their motivations and character arcs. Cyborg goes from being depressing and distasteful to fleshed-out in Snyder's Cut. Same goes for the other characters; Batman is back to being his serious team-leading self, the Flash is given laughable humor along with several compelling scenes that make you root for the character at the end of the day, Wonder Woman is brutal, yet hopeful compared to her bland counterpart in Whedon's take, and finally, Aquaman doesn't despise the world around him during the 120-minute runtime. The 2 extra hours given to this film is a much-needed breath of fresh air to delve deep into knowledge of the heroes' and villains' reasonings of why they do what they do. And, last but not least, the CGI is very impressive for the limited resources and small timeframe given to complete this movie. A round of applause is deserved for this modern-day superhero masterpiece.\",\n"," \"Wish this was the first and only. Also a screw everyone that complains about the length.

The character development had me caring about what happened next, the action was solid and the new scenes really tied everything together. I can't believe it.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. So much better than the other version, which in fact, did not even resemble this version. Despite being 4 hours long, it went by so fast. The other version was too much like a Marvel movie which contains as much comedy as adventure. DC comics is usually much darker, much more grown up compared its Marvel counterpart. The version of Justice League gave so much more back story to each character and their different journeys to becoming part of this elite team.

Cyborg as the emotional core of the film is pivotal, culminating in a far more satisfying (and character-informed) finale when he rips apart the Mother Box's unity. The time reverse sequence with The Flash also harkens back to an emotional connection Barry has with his father, and it's also visually arresting. Batman being doggedly committed to resurrecting Superman because he now understands the importance of him and what he represents is much more meaningful in this film because it is more clear that Bruce, once cynical and grim, now operates from a place of faith. He believes in what Superman stands for. The addition of Superman's two fathers speaking wisdom and conviction into their son was also magnificent. And Darkseid's inclusion is bittersweet because this may be the last time we actually get to see him in this version of the DCEU.

Painful to see what could have been (Batfleck, Henry Cavill, Cyborg), but glorious to see Snyder's vision for this film--if not for the extended universe--come to life. The personality of the characters have got their due. A four hour span provides that deserved depth that was missing in the initial release. A Justice League movie truly worthy of the title. A visually stunning, multilayered masterclass in cinema. A film that stands as proof that you can divert from the cookie cutter Superhero formula and deliver something unique and great.","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]}]}
